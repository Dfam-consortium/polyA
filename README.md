# Get to work (from within project directory)
pipenv shell

# Fetch dependencies
pipenv install --dev

# Add a runtime dependency
pipenv install <package>

# Add a development dependency
pipenv install --dev package

### Unit Tests

Unit tests use [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/latest/). The linked documentation contains examples
of how to use it to both write and run tests. The
[examples](https://pytest.org/en/latest/example/index.html) are quite extensive.

Documentation tests are also fine for simple cases.

```
# Run tests
pytest
```
